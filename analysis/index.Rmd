# TransElement

Collaborated project at [Gilad Lab](http://giladlab.uchicago.edu/) and [Stephens Lab](http://stephenslab.uchicago.edu/).

## Overview

The basic idea is firstly to get an overview of how the distribution of the H3K9me3 mark differs between the 2 species and secondly whether there are particular transposable elements that are silenced specifically in one species and try to get at a mechanism for this as transposable element silencing is a rapidly evolving phenomenon.

## Differential H3K9me3 in Human and Chimp (DESeq2)

## Apply ASH for DEseq2 results

* [using half-uniform misture components](ash_deseq2_halfuniform.html)
