# transposable_element

Collaborated project at [Gilad Lab](http://giladlab.uchicago.edu/) and [Stephens Lab](http://stephenslab.uchicago.edu/).

## Overview

The basic idea is firstly to get an overview of how the distribution of the H3K9me3 mark differs between the 2 species and secondly whether there are particular transposable elements that are silenced specifically in one species and try to get at a mechanism for this as transposable element silencing is a rapidly evolving phenomenon. My collaborator can do the transposable element analysis in each species separately but we are likely to need help for the cross-species analysis. We would then ideally want to relate any differences in H3K9me3 occupancy with changes in gene expression.
